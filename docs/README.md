# Main features:

    # Quickly and space-efficiently organise EDF files into a representation of a continuous recording.
    # Deal with overlapping data in as space-efficient manner as possible.
    # Perform analysis on the continuous data without producing a large continuous file.
    # Allow production of a large continuous file, using the aforementioned representation, which can be analysed using
        another library such as mne-python.
