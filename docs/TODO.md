# Overlap Resolution
    # what to do if collated file for 909 is present?
        # i.e, EVERYTHING overlaps
        # one thing; DO NTO SAVE OUTPUT OF EDF_COLLATE TO INPUT DIR
        # 
    # overlap summary matrix
        # maybe per file?
            # row for each TYPE of overlap
            # colums like "number of pairs of overlapping files"


# Misc
    # 895 - channels g14 vs G14?
    # find dog data and run it on that

# Major things left TODO
    # RESAMPLING!
        # needs to be done before any overlap resolution!
    # so far, only removed files where MOST FREQUENT SR IS OUTLIER
        # files with 1 or 2 channels with a weird sampel rate will remain.

# Analysis
    # mne-python

# TODO generally
    # not sure if working with 3 shifted test
